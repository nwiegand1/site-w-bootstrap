			<h2>Other Pursuits</h2>

			<h3> I love to cook and most of my favorite recipes come from the Smitten Kitchen.
			I don't have a kitchen in college, so I go to my friends kitchens whenever possible to cook
			and have made many cooking experiments in the microwave in my dorm.</h3>
			
			<h3>I also love being outside and am outside whenever possible. My friends know me
			as the one who will always walk, instead of ubering, if she can. I am running my first
			half-marathon in March (!) and am hoping to climb Mt. Whitney this summer, if I get 
			a permit!</h3>
